        "**Answer:**\n",
        "Data structures are specific ways of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently.\n",
        "\n",
        "Examples include lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets in Python. They are important because they allow programmers to manage data effectively, perform operations faster, and write optimized and clean code depending on the type of data and required operations.\n",

        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "Dictionaries store data in **key-value pairs**. Each key must be unique and is hashed to find its value quickly. The data is stored in an internal structure called a **hash table**, which allows fast access, insertion, and deletion.\n",

        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "A set is used when you need to store **unique values only** and do not care about the order. Sets are faster for **membership testing** (`in` keyword) and automatically eliminate **duplicate elements**, unlike lists.\n",

        "### 6. **What is a string in Python, and how is it different from a list?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "A string is a sequence of characters enclosed in quotes, e.g., `\"Hello\"`. It is **immutable**, meaning it cannot be changed.\n",
        "A list is a sequence of elements (can be of any data type) and is **mutable**.\n",

        "### 7. **How do tuples ensure data integrity in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "Tuples are immutable, meaning once created, their data cannot be changed. This makes them ideal for storing **constant or fixed data**, ensuring that the information remains secure and unchanged throughout the program.\n",

        "### 8. **What is a hash table, and how does it relate to dictionaries in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "A hash table is a data structure that maps **keys to values** using a hash function. Python’s dictionaries are built on top of hash tables, allowing for **O(1)** average time complexity for accessing, inserting, and deleting values using keys.\n",

        "\n",
        "### 9. **Can lists contain different data types in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "Yes. Python lists are **heterogeneous**, meaning they can store elements of different data types together.\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "my_list = [1, \"hello\", 3.14, True]\n",
        "```\n",

        "\n",
        "### 10. **Explain why strings are immutable in Python.**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "Strings are immutable in Python to enhance **performance, memory efficiency**, and **security**. Since strings are used frequently, immutability allows them to be **interned** (shared), which saves memory. It also prevents accidental changes in sensitive text data.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 11. **What advantages do dictionaries offer over lists for certain tasks?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "Dictionaries offer **faster data retrieval** using keys (O(1) time), which is efficient compared to linear search in lists (O(n)). They are better for storing **structured data**, such as student records, where each entry is accessed using a unique key like a student ID.\n",

        "### 12. **Describe a scenario where using a tuple would be preferable over a list.**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "A tuple is preferable when storing **coordinates**, like `(x, y)`, because the values should not change. Another example is using tuples as **keys in a dictionary**, since tuples are hashable and immutable, while lists are not.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 13. **How do sets handle duplicate values in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "Sets **automatically remove duplicates**. When duplicate elements are added to a set, only one copy is retained.\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "my_set = {1, 2, 2, 3}\n",
        "print(my_set)  # Output: {1, 2, 3}\n",

        "### 14. **How does the “in” keyword work differently for lists and dictionaries?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* In a **list**, the `in` keyword checks if a **value** exists.\n",
        "* In a **dictionary**, the `in` keyword checks if a **key** exists.\n",
        "  Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "5 in [1, 2, 5]         # True (checks value)  \n",
        "'name' in {'name': 'Ram'}  # True (checks key)\n",
        "```\n",

        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 15. **Can you modify the elements of a tuple? Explain why or why not.**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "No, you cannot modify elements of a tuple because tuples are **immutable**. Once a tuple is created, its values cannot be changed, added, or removed. This feature helps maintain **data integrity**.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 16. **What is a nested dictionary, and give an example of its use case.**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "A nested dictionary is a dictionary inside another dictionary. It is useful for representing **complex hierarchical data**, like a database of students.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "students = {\n",
        "    \"101\": {\"name\": \"Amit\", \"age\": 18},\n",
        "    \"102\": {\"name\": \"Neha\", \"age\": 17}\n",

        "```\n",

        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 17. **Describe the time complexity of accessing elements in a dictionary.**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "The average time complexity for accessing elements in a dictionary is **O(1)**, meaning constant time. This is due to the underlying **hash table** implementation. However, in rare cases (hash collisions), it may degrade to **O(n)**.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 18. **In what situations are lists preferred over dictionaries?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "Lists are preferred when:\n",
        "\n",
        "* You need to maintain **order**\n",
        "* The data doesn’t need to be labeled by keys\n",
        "* You’re performing **sequential operations**\n",
        "* Storing items like a **shopping list or queue**\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 19. **Why are dictionaries considered unordered, and how does that affect data retrieval?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "Before Python 3.7, dictionaries were unordered, meaning key-value pairs had no guaranteed order. This meant retrieval was based on keys, not position. From Python 3.7+, they maintain **insertion order**, but retrieval is still by **key**, not index.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 20. **Explain the difference between a list and a dictionary in terms of data retrieval.**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* **List:** Data is retrieved using **index numbers** (e.g., `list[0]`)\n",
        "* **Dictionary:** Data is retrieved using **keys** (e.g., `dict[\"name\"]`)\n",
        "\n",
